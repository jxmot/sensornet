# sensornet

# Overview

SensorNet - An IoT project that connects ESP8266 based sensors through a NodeJS server which forwards sensor data to a database. The web client received notifications when sensor status or data is updated.

# Submodules

This project currently consists of 3 submodules - 

* Sensors - [esp8266-dht-udp](<https://github.com/jxmot/esp8266-dht-udp>)
* A NodeJS server - [node-dht-udp](<https://github.com/jxmot/node-dht-udp>)
* Client - [client-dht-udp](<https://github.com/jxmot/client-dht-udp>)

Each module repository contains a README. Please note that this project is a *work in progress* and is subject to changes and additions.

**NOTE:** The repo links above point to the original submodule repositories. They *may* be different from what is pointed to within this repository. I will update this repository with the submodules changes when they hit milestones.
